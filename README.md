# mtDNA Processing Pipeline

Welcome to the **mtDNA Processing Pipeline**, a streamlined and efficient solution for processing raw FASTQ files from mtDNA sequences generated using the Nimagen Kit. This pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) to ensure scalability and reproducibility across a variety of computational environments.

---

## Overview

The pipeline automates the essential steps for processing mtDNA sequencing data, including:

1. **Merging**: Combines overlapping paired-end reads to improve sequence accuracy.
2. **Trimming**: Removes adapters and low-quality bases from reads to prepare for mapping.
3. **Mapping**: Aligns trimmed reads to a reference mitochondrial genome.
4. **Variant Calling**: Identifies variants from the mapped reads.

This pipeline is designed for high-throughput processing and produces high-quality results ready for downstream analyses.

## Features

- **Reproducible**: Ensures consistent results across runs.
- **Scalable**: Handles large datasets on local, cluster, or cloud environments.
- **Customizable**: Easily configure reference genomes, trimming parameters, and variant-calling tools.

## Requirements

### Software
- **Nextflow**: >= 22.10.0
- **Java**: >= 8
- **Docker** or **Singularity** (optional, for containerized execution)

### Dependencies
The pipeline requires the following tools, which can be managed via conda or containers:
- [FASTQ merger (e.g., PEAR)](https://github.com/tseemann/PEAR)
- [Trimming tool (e.g., Trimmomatic or Cutadapt)](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/)
- [Alignment tool (e.g., BWA)](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/)
- [Variant caller (e.g., GATK or FreeBayes)](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/)
